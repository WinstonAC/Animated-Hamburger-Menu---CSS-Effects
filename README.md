# Animated-Hamburger-Menu---CSS-Effects
 2.16.21 

 
Today I learned how to create an animated hamburger menu! I followed a tutorial on CSS effects by codeStack. 

 WHY: I choose to learn this skill to advance my CSS skillset and review Vanilla CSS and HTML.
 HOW: I'll incorporate this new skill into new and existing projects!
